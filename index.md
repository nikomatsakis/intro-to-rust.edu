Hi! My name is Niko Matsakis. I've been working in Rust a long time, and so I expect some of you know who I am already, but for the rest of y'all, let me introduce myself.

I started working on Rust in 2010. I was involved in the very first public release of Rust, 0.1. We've come a long way since those days! As one tiny exmaple, when I started, Rust was 32-bit only. My first contribution, as I recall, was implementing support for 64-bit systems. Good times. Since then, I've been involved in a lot of other things. I was the first lead of the Rust compiler team and was involved in the Rust core team, back when that was a thing. At this point though my primary role is as co-lead of the Rust language design team.

Since 2021, I've been working at Amazon, where I manage our Rust team. This is a team of folks whose full-time job is to contribute to the Rust project, Tokio, and other parts of the ecosystem. As some of you may know, Amazon's been making very heavy use of Rust. At this point, every S3 GET request, every Lambda invocation, and a good number of other things make use of services implemented in Rust. Being at Amazon has been a really interesting experience, since it lets me work very closely with the teams here, figuring out exactly where Rust can help them -- and where it holds them up. We can then take those lessons, mix them with the experiences of others in other contexts, and find ways to make Rust better for everyone.

# Rust adoption

Of course, the watershed moment was when Rust appeared in the batgirl comic in 2017.
Boom, our job is done!

Oh, and I'd like to callout that she says Rust is not complicated. Thanks batgirl comic authors! 
I like this PR.

# Rust adoption

* Rust in the cloud

???

We are seeing Rust in the cloud. Both to build the cloud itself, like at (hello!) Amazon and Microsoft, but also to build things *in* the cloud. A lot of people are finding that writing their cloud apps in Rust is a good choice. It saves them money. It requires less beefy machines and runs more reliably. 

--

* Rust in kernels

???

We are seeing Rust in kernels -- Rust for linux? Amazing. Windows kernel? Amazing. 

Rust was designed to be versatile, usable for high-level and low-level applications alike, and seeing it stretch from the machine kernel up to distributed applications in the cloud is a really cool validation of that design.

* Rust in **your** workplace?

???

For more and more people, working in Rust is a reality. 
If you're using Rust in your workplace, I'd love to hear about it after the talk.
But maybe you're not yet, and you'd like to be.
Or maybe you yourself are not convinced, and you'd like to know what all the fuss is about.

# Why do people *start* using Rust?

**Efficiency:**

> **Our decision to use Rust was about tail latency.** We didn’t want the tail latency. The better tail latencies with Rust were crazy significant.
> <br><br>
> .small[— Rust developer, 2022]

???

To answer that, I think you have to break the question into two questions. The first one is why do they *start* using Rust. And for many, the answer is "performance" -- that's what gets people's attention. Look at this quote from an experience Rust developer. The reason they picked up Rust was that they were looking to achieve tighter tail latencies, and they found that since Rust didn't require a garbage collector, it offered a big advantage in that regard.

Or, to put it in picture form...

---

# Why do people *start* using Rust?

.center[
.p60[![Wiley prepares to fly](./images/wiley-batman-prepare.gif)]
]

???

...they wanted to feel like this! And it's true that, on average, Rust programs tend to perform really, really well. At the same time, the programming language is only a small piece of whether a program runs quikly. My experience is that while performance may get people *interested* in Rust, what makes them *love* Rust is something different.

---

# Why do people *keep* using Rust?

**Reliability:**

> **If we were to make it again, the other reason is correctness.** A lot of our worst outages have been about unexpected exceptions. In Rust, every error response is enumerated in the type system and there’s the right syntactical goodness to handle it without being heavy weight. That is really nice.
> <br><br>
> .small[— Same Rust developer, 2022]

???

Here is that same Rust developer, continuing their statement. See what they are saying here? What they found as they built things in Rust was that, yes, predictable performance is great, but the *real* win comes from the fact that things tend to "just work" more often than not.

.footnote[From a [2019 Rust whitepaper](https://www.rust-lang.org/static/pdfs/Rust-npm-Whitepaper.pdf).]

???

This is something we've been hearing a long time. Here is a quote from a whitepaper we wrote in the Rust open source org, around 2019, talking about NPM's adoption of Rust. You can see this engineer said what he likes about Rust is that it's *boring* -- he isn't getting "exciting" pages in the middle of the night.

# Efficiency *requires* Reliability

.center[.p60[![Wiley prepares to fly](./images/wiley-batman-prepare.gif)]]

???

But really, these two things, efficiency and reliability, they are not in conflict. In fact, they require each other. After all, for the most part, efficiency doesn't come fro mthe programming language. It comes from architectural decisions that you make in developing the code. So why don't people just make these same architectures using some other language?

---

# Efficiency *requires* Reliability

.center[.p60[![Wiley crashes and burns](./images/wiley-batman-fail.gif)]]

???

The answer is: experience. They've tried, and they found that when they build really ambitious designs, they tend to fall over. This is very much true in C++, where you run into segmentation faults and the like, but it's also true in languges with a garbage collector. In that case, it might be data races, or weird problems caused by mutating some shared structures.

???

Here is a quote from Seth Markle, talking about the S3 BlobAssembler library. What they found was, after rewriting in Rust, they were able to do a bunch of optimizations they had wanted to do for a long time, but which they were too afraid to do in the old codebase.

I have a theory for why this is. Rust's goal was to have the compiler detect the memory safety errors in your code and flag them ahead of time. But **compilers are not very smart**. I mean, hey, we didn't have ChatGPT yet. So, to make this work, we have a type system that makes you structure your code in a way that correctness is obvious. It pushes you to a shallower structure, with fewer dense object graphs and more explicit parameters and connections between code. Without that, the compiler just can't understand your code.

But here's the catch: **neither can you**.  I mean, maybe you can when you are writing it. But can you understand it when it's 2am and you got woken up with an urgent bug report? Or, perhaps more importantly, can your *intern* understand it? Will they remember all the invariants they have to maintain to get it working right?

# The Rust 2024 Edition is coming

![Dancing Ferris](./images/dancing-ferris.gif)

???

---

# Rust editions in a nutshell

"Breaking changes where no code breaks"

* Every crate declares its *Rust edition* (e.g., `edition = "2024"`)
* Compiler understands *all* editions
* Editions interoperate (we never split the ecosystem)
* Adopting the newest edition is automated
    * Just run `cargo fix --edition`

--

What all this means:

* Upgrade on **your schedule, not ours**
    * (and not your dependencies' either)

---

# Type system improvements

* ▰▰▰▰▰ Generic associated types 
* ▰▰▰▰▱ Async functions in traits ()
* ▰▰▰▱▱ Type alias impl trait
* ▰▰▱▱▱ Impl trait "everywhere"
* ▰▱▱▱▱ Implied bounds
